Projects proposed results: calculate the total amount to be charged to a customer at checkout, given their state and a list of items to be purchased. The function must include sales tax and cannot be used to process refunds. The function should only handle transactions for customers from New Jersey, Delaware, and Pennsylvania. The items sold are limited to three types: WIC Eligible food, Clothing, and "everything else". The tax rules for these three states are as follows: Delaware has no sales tax, New Jersey has a sales tax rate of 6.6%, and Pennsylvania has a sales tax rate of 6%. WIC Eligible food is tax exempt in all three states. Clothing is exempt from sales tax in PA and NJ, except for fur clothing which is taxable in NJ. All other items fall under the default tax rates.
